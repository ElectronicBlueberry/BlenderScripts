# --- Multi Angle Rendering Script ---
#  This script will render the current scene,
#  rotating the defined 'object' 'steps' times

#  Configure it via the 'cfg' global dict, and run the script
#  to start rendering. You can safely cancel the render at any time

#  I found simmilar solutions online, however they were all using
#  the main context to render, causing blender to freeze up during the
#  render process

#  This script executes the render in the same way as pressing
#  "render" in the ui,
#  providing a live render preview and keeping the ui responsive,
#  making it suitable for rendering complex scenes, or long animations
#  from multiple angles

#  The render results can be found in subfolders in your set output path.

cfg = {
	'object': "Armature",	# what object to rotate
	'steps': 8				# how many times to rotate (in fractions of 360Â°)
}
